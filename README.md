Food Journal for iOS
====================

Food Journal allows users to capture photos of their meals, briefly describe them, and post them to an automatically formatted WordPress blog.

Food Journal was developed by Alexsander Akers for the [ADI DevFest](http://devfe.st) 2013 hackathon. The original idea and implementation for Food Journal is by [Dan Schlosser](http://danrs.ch/).
